        <div id="preamble-whitman">
          <p>One of my favorite poems in English. I have a bunch of German poems that are closer to my heart, but also harder to share, so this was a good compromise. I love the rhythm of this one. </p>

            <em>O you</em> whom I often and silently come where you are, that I may be with you;
            As I walk by your side, or sit near, or remain in the same room with you,
            Little you know the <em>subtle electric <span class="fire">fire</span></em> that for your sake is playing within me.

        <div id="preamble-shakespeare">
          <p>I so wanted to love all of Shakespeare's sonnets, but they never really moved me all that much. I liked this one though when I read it at age 16 or so, and I really like the "and saved my life" part.</p>

            Those lips that Love's own hand did make<br>
            Breathed forth the sound that said <span class="her-words">'I hate'</span><br>
            To me that languish'd for her sake;<br>
            But when she saw my woeful state,<br>
            Straight in her heart did mercy come,<br>
            Chiding that tongue that ever sweet<br>
            Was used in giving gentle doom,<br>
            And taught it thus anew to greet:<br>
            <span class="her-words">'I hate'</span> she alter'd with an end,<br>
            That follow'd it as gentle day<br>
            Doth follow night, who like a fiend<br>
            From heaven to hell is flown away;<br>
            <span class="her-words">'I hate'</span> from hate away she threw,<br>
            And saved my life, saying <span class="her-words">'not you.'</span>

            A Coffin—is a small Domain,<br>
            Yet able to contain<br>
            A Citizen of Paradise<br>
            In its diminished Plane.
            <p>
              A Grave—is a restricted Breadth—<br>
              Yet ampler than the Sun—<br>
              And all the Seas He populates<br>
              And Lands He looks upon
            </p>
            <p>
              To Him who on its small Repose<br>
              Bestows a single Friend—<br>
              Circumference without Relief—<br>
              Or Estimate—or End—
