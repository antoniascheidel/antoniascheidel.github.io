    <h1 class="bold">My Skillcrush Experience So Far</h1>
    <p>So far, dealing with the code editor has been a mixed experience. Here are some pros and cons, to be taken with a grain of salt because I realize that I'm not the target audience.</p>
        <h3 class="bold">Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It's always nice to see changes in real time, especially with the css.</li>
            <li>I like the challenge of having to actually type out everything without relying on the autocomplete that Sublime Text does for me.</li>
            <li>I still love everything about this blueprint, so it'll be a while before the cons eat up all that love. And I realize that the editor is just a place to get started, and it's awesome for that!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="bold">Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Being used to Sublime Text, I do miss being able to move lines around and typing out every tag by hand does get old pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The automatic indentation is not consistent and makes organizing the code a bit difficult.</li>
            <li>It really bothers me that the editor does not scroll â€” after ten lines of code, the side-by-side view of editor and page no longer works and I'm stuck with a really narrow editor and a lot of white: <img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s366/sh/7a127fdc-4618-4435-a4d5-16efd41427b3/1d051eead90d398ea09afe5c3d41d985/deep/0/Screen-Shot-2014-05-12-at-14.25.18-PM.png" alt="Screenshot of white next to scrolled-down editor" width="500px" class="screenshot"></li>
            <li>The caret takes up the entire height of the line, but the font does not. Depending on the contents of the line, the text I'm typing either hovers right below the line, or even sits on the line: <img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s366/sh/fb59d6e1-6032-47ea-9885-467497fcee43/7f3936c75fff4df6105451fb07e48e14/deep/0/Antonia-go-wild-in-our-code-editor----Skillcrush.png" alt="Screenshot of inconsistent vertical text alignment" width="300px" class="screenshot"> </li>
            <li>Sometimes the caret becomes unresponsive or disappears and has to be coaxed back by switching between html and css, or even reloading. Right now all is great, but earlier today I kept having to count how often I had pressed which arrow key.</li>
            <li>I love awards! They made me really happy, but I would have expected them to fade. Since screen real estate is so limited, I had to comment out the display: block so I could work properly. <img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s366/sh/7a2acfb4-93dd-4a42-ab74-40899ef253c5/79cd241e602b52f56a45a0a653988ee3/deep/0/Antonia-go-wild-in-our-code-editor----Skillcrush.png" alt="Screenshot awards covering up the page" width="400px" class="screenshot"></li>
