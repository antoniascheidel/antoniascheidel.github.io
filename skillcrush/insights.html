    <h1 class="bold">Lessons Learned</h1>
    <p>This is just a summary (and reinforcement) of the things I learned in the course of this project.</p>
    <ul>
            <li> I had trouble getting the poem container to actually cover all of the poem and the author pic. I couldn't figure out how to get the container to grow to the right size, and also why it wouldn't do that automatically. For reference, I searched for "parent div doesn't expand to child height" and learned that <div class="quote">
              <p>Parent elements are never to expand to contain floated elements. IE does this but it's a bug in IE. Firefox, and all the other browsers, perform correctly.</p>
              <p>The floated element is removed from the normal flow of things and is allowed to overflow the containing element. By adding 'overflow:auto' to the parent, you are telling it to automatically expand itself to contain all elements that would normally overflow the box.</p> <div class="author">source: <a href="http://www.codingforums.com/html-css/164758-div-tag-doesnt-expand-height.html" target="blank"> codingforums</a></div></div>
              For what it's worth, I ran into the same problem for this quote box because the author line is floated. I guess that'll help me remember!</li>
              <li>
                  <p>For the quote box, I couldn't get the rounded corners to display properly using border-radius: 10%, see here:<div style="background-color: AliceBlue; border-radius:10%; width: 100px; height: 40px"></div></p>
                  <p>It worked when I set the height to something ridiculously long - or rather, it looked fine when I tried with a height of 400px and a width of 400px. It should have occurred to me then that the reason why it worked for that case was that height and width were the same.</p><p> Because I had used a percentage for my rounded corners, the horizontal radius was set to 10% of the width of the box, and the vertical radius to 10% of the height of the box. In other words, giving a percentage would only work for squares where height and width are the same. To solve the problem for my box, I switched the border radius to 20px and it worked nicely. (<a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/rounded-border/" target="blank">This</a> helped me understand rounded corners better.)</p>
